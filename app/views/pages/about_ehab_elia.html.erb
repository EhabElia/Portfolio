				<h2>Hello. My name is<br> <span class="hightlight">ehab elia</span></h2>
				
				<p>I was born in 1981 in Cairo - Egypt and moved to France in 2007. I worked in different fields like TV, Tourism and Marketing. I'm an adept of open source and militates for a fair sharing economy and society. I worked with <a href="http://ouishare.net/en", target="blank", class="btn-in-paragraph">OuiShare</a> on different projects as a Tech Lead.</p>

				<p>Conscious of the social and entreprenerial scope of coding, I joined <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/", target="blank", class="btn-in-paragraph">Le Wagon</a> and became a Fullstack developper Ruby on Rails.</p>


				<p class="bold">Now I'm building the first Physical Commuinty & Incubator for Developers.</p>
